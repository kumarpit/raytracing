## Raytracing In One Weekend-ish
This is a Rust based implementation of the basic ray tracer described in Peter Shirley's book [Raytracing in One Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf). The primary objective behind building this project was to explore the Rust language.
